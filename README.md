# GreenBelt
This repository showcases selected analytical and research projects demonstrating my approach to structured problem-solving, data analysis, and insight generation. The work focuses on breaking down ambiguous problems and supporting decisions through clear, evidence-based analysis.

The primary project applies the Lean Six Sigma (DMA) framework to a real-world business problem, covering problem definition, Voice of Customer analysis, quantitative defect measurement, root cause identification, and solution prioritization. The emphasis is on accuracy, structure, and translating analysis into practical recommendations.

These projects reflect skills relevant to research and advisory roles, including secondary research, data synthesis, analytical reasoning, and clear documentation. The repository is shared to demonstrate thinking and approach rather than advanced software development.
